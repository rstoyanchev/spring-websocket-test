## Overview

Demonstrates Spring WebSocket and SockJS support in the Spring Framework.

**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch contains examples using Spring's `WebSocketHandler` including with SockJS fallback options. The `endpoint` branch contains examples of using JSR-356 `Endpoint` and `@ServerEndpoint`.

**NOTE:** Also check out the [Stock Portfolio](https://github.com/rstoyanchev/spring-websocket-portfolio) sample that demonstrates the use of a higher-level messaging over WebSocket.

### Tomcat

Set `TOMCAT_HOME` as an environment variable and use [deployTomcat.sh](https://github.com/rstoyanchev/spring-websocket-test/blob/master/deployTomcat.sh) and [shutdownTomcat.sh](https://github.com/rstoyanchev/spring-websocket-test/blob/master/shutdownTomcat.sh) in this directory.

Open a browser and go to <http://localhost:8080/spring-websocket-test/index.html>

### Jetty

The easiest way to run on Jetty is with `mvn jetty:run`.

Open a browser and go to <http://localhost:8080/spring-websocket-test/index.html>

**Note:** To deploy to a Jetty installation, add this to Jetty's `start.ini`:

    OPTIONS=plus
    etc/jetty-plus.xml
    OPTIONS=annotations
    etc/jetty-annotations.xml

### WildFly 10+

Unzip the WildFly server.

Set `WILDFLY_HOME` as an environment variable and use [deployWildFly.sh](https://github.com/rstoyanchev/spring-websocket-test/blob/master/deployWildFly.sh) in this directory.

Open a browser and go to <http://localhost:8080/spring-websocket-portfolio/index.html>

### WebSphere Liberty 16+

Build and deploy with the following server configuration:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <server description="new server">
        <!-- Enable features -->
        <featureManager>
            <feature>jsp-2.3</feature>
            <feature>webSocket-1.1</feature>
        </featureManager>
        <!-- To access this server from a remote client add a host attribute to the following element, e.g. host="*" -->
        <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
                      httpPort="9080"
                      httpsPort="9443" />
        <!-- Automatically expand WAR files and EAR files -->
        <applicationManager autoExpand="true"/>
    </server>

### Glassfish

Glassfish 4 provides JSR-356 support.

Download Glassfish 4 and unzip the downloaded distribution.

Start the server:

    cd <unzip_dir>/glassfish4
    bin/asadmin start-domain

Deploy the WAR file using the script in this directory.

Open a browser and go to <http://localhost:8080/spring-websocket-test/index.html>

Watch the logs:

    cd <unzip_dir>/glassfish4
    less `glassfish/domains/domain1/logs/server.log`

### What is websocket?
Websockets allow us to have two way conversation between server and client. There are many websocket libraries such as Socket.io . These are mainly used when there is a need to make a chat functionality for the app.
